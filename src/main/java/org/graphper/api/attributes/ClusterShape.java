/**
 * The description object of the cluster shape, which describes a series of characteristics of the
 * shape. For some implementations of system default, please check {@link ClusterShapeEnum}.
 *
 * <p>Custom cluster shapes can directly implement this interface and assign values to clusters
 * directly. A series of descriptions of this interface play an important role in the layout of the
 * cluster container size, center of gravity and line segment clipping, but if you need to render
 * the cluster, you need to implement {@link CustomizeShapeRender}, and register through SPI or
 * manually call {@link CustomizeShapeRender#register(CustomizeShapeRender)}.
 *
 * <p>Unlike {@link NodeShape}, other cluster shapes except {@link ClusterShapeEnum#RECT} no
 * guarantee that cluster container will surround all nodes under {@link Layout#DOT} engine but will
 * try best estimated the container size by {@link #minContainerSize(double, double)} method, but
 * still have the following principles as much as possible surround all nodes:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The gap between internal box and external box is as small ass possible, it means output
 *   of {@link #minContainerSize(double, double)} of current shape close enough than input.
 *   e.g, {@link ClusterShapeEnum#RECT} no gap between internal and external boxes.
 *   <li>Internal nodes are kept isolated from external nodes of cluster, it means interact edges
 *   from internal nodes to external nodes as little as possible.
 *   <li>Avoid cluster nesting as much as possible if cluster shapes is not {@link ClusterShapeEnum#RECT}
 *   (or the cluster shape no gap between internal and external box like RECT shape), the error in
 *   evaluation will be magnified in this case.
 *   <li>Manual adjust {@link org.graphper.api.Cluster.ClusterBuilder#margin(double)} reserve enough
 *   internal space to avoid nodes overflow cluster container.
 * </ul>
