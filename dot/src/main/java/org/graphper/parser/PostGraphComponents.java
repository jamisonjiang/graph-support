/**
 * An optional hook interface for customizing or "post-processing" various
 * graph components (nodes, edges, clusters, entire graphs) after they have
 * been initially constructed during the parsing phase.
 *
 * <p>By implementing this interface, callers can provide logic in any of the
 * default methods to modify or decorate the corresponding builder classes
 * (e.g., {@link NodeBuilder}, {@link LineBuilder}, {@link ClusterBuilder},
 * and {@link GraphvizBuilder}). If no customization is needed, the default
 * (empty) method bodies have no effect.</p>
 *
 * <p>Typical usage involves passing an instance of this interface to the
 * parser or listener, which will invoke these methods at appropriate times
 * before final objects are built.</p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class MyPostGraphComponents implements PostGraphComponents {
 *     @Override
 *     public void postNode(NodeBuilder nodeBuilder) {
 *         // For example, always apply a bold style to nodes
 *         nodeBuilder.fontStyle(FontStyle.BOLD);
 *     }
 *
 *     @Override
 *     public void postLine(LineBuilder lineBuilder) {
